## Low Level Project
![header](sphere.gif)

This is a simple demonstration of a primitive object using [three,js](https://threejs.org/).
For this project, I wanted to produce something interesting to look at, so I decided to make a
"wormhole-like" sphere. To achieve this effect, I used a primitive sphere with a negative radius, 
such that when the texture is applied it is on the "inside."
